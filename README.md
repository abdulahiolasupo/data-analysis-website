Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?
Scenario and Role
As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I work on the marketing analyst team. 
Our goal is to maximize the number of annual memberships, which the director of marketing believes is crucial for the company's future success. 
To achieve this, my team is analyzing how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
We aim to use these insights to design a new marketing strategy that converts casual riders into annual members. 
Our recommendations must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to gain approval from Cyclistic executives.


In this project, I will share my insights and provide recommendations on the marketing strategies that will contribute to the company’s remarkable success. 
To ensure a structured and thorough analysis, I will follow Google’s data analysis process, consisting of six key steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
