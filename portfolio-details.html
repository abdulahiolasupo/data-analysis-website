              <h2>Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?</h2>
              <h3><strong>Scenario and Role</strong></h3>
<p>As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I work on the marketing analyst team. Our goal is to maximize the number of annual memberships, which the director of marketing believes is crucial for the company's future success. To achieve this, my team is analyzing how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. We aim to use these insights to design a new marketing strategy that converts casual riders into annual members. Our recommendations must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to gain approval from Cyclistic executives.</p>


<h4><strong>Characters and teams</strong></h4>
<ul><li>Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
</li></ul><ul><li>Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for
the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
These may include email, social media, and other channels.
    
</li></ul><ul><li>Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for
collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s
mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help
Cyclistic achieve them.
    
</li></ul><ul><li>Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide
whether to approve the recommended marketing program.</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h4><strong>About the company</strong></h4>
<p>In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations
across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime.</p><p>Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the
flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.</p><p>Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.</p><p>Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.</p><p>As a junior data analyst on Moreno's team, my role involved delving into the company's historical bike trip data. The objective was to identify trends that could inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.</p>
<h2>Ask</h2>
<strong>Business Task:</strong><p>Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.</p>
<ul><li><strong>How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</strong></li></ul><p></p>

<p></p><ul><li>Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?</li></ul><p></p>

<p></p><ul><li>How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?</li></ul>
<p>I have been tasked with addressing the initial inquiry, which entails conducting a detailed comparison between annual members and casual riders. My analysis will delve deep into this comparison, aiming to uncover valuable insights that will inform our strategic decisions moving forward.</p>

<p>For a comprehensive analysis, we procured Cyclistic's historical trip data spanning from November 2019 to May 2023. This valuable dataset was generously provided by Motivate International Inc. under a licensing agreement, allowing us to delve deep into meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making.</p>

<p>The datasets was downloaded from the designated website and organized into a dedicated folder named “201911–202305_Cyclistic".

<h2>Prepare</h2>
<ul><li>The datasets was downloaded and unzip the files into a dedicated folder named "201911–202305_Cyclistic."</li></ul><ul><li>I created subfolders within the dedicated folder for .csv file and .xls file to maintain the original data structure and save downloaded files into appropriate subfolders.
</li></ul><ul><li>Each of the file (.csv) was imported to Google Sheet seperately, saved them as an Excel Workbook file into the subfolder created for .xls files.</li></ul><ul><li>I open the first .xls file (Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.xlsx) and insert a column called "ride_length." Calculate the length of each ride by subtracting the column "started_at" from the column "ended_at" and format it as HH:MM:SS using Format &gt; Cells &gt; Time &gt; 37:30:55.</li></ul><ul><li>Another column was inserted named "day_of_week" and calculate the day of the week that each ride started by using the WEEKDAY command. Format the result as a number with no decimals.</li></ul><ul><li>The same descriptive analysis steps was followed for the second file (Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.xlsx).</li></ul>

<h2>Process</h2>



<p>In order to further my analysis, I will be using RStudio to clean, analyze, and aggregate due to the large amount of data we are dealing with.</p><p>RStudio is an integrated development environment for R.</p><p>R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.</p><p>To begin with, I lunch my RStudio software and I open a new script  as this will serve as a workspace for executing the necessary code on the Cyclistic trip data.</p><p>I will set the working directory to the path of the folder that was created earlier on. setwd("C:/User/lenovo%20pc/Downloads/201911-202305_Cyclistic")</p><p>At first I need to load all the R packages needed to perform the data manipulation.</p><h5>Note: "#" followed by a single-line text is just a comment to explain R code, and to make it more readable</h5><p>install.packages("tidyverse")</p><p>library(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data</p>

<h5><strong>Comparing number of rides by rider type on days of the week</strong></h5>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>Findings:</strong></h5>
<p></p>
<h5>Our data analysis reveals distinct usage patterns between casual riders and members, particularly regarding bike usage on different days of the week. Member riders exhibit significantly higher trip frequency compared to casual riders, suggesting they likely use the bikes for exercise, leisure, and recreational activities during their free time. This indicates a preference for personal use, highlighting the convenience and versatility of the bikes for exploring the city.</h5>

<h5><strong>Comparing Average Duration of the bike usage by rider type</strong></h5>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>Findings:</strong></h5>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5>This visualization underscores a significant disparity in bike usage patterns between casual riders and members. It is evident that casual riders primarily utilize the bikes for transportation or commuting purposes, relying on them for work and weekday commitments. The notable increase in bike usage on Thursdays and Fridays suggests a strategic opportunity as these days mark the end of the workweek with reduced vehicular traffic, making cycling more appealing. By leveraging this insight, we can attract both casual riders and members to utilize the bikes more frequently, tapping into their transportation needs and encouraging sustainable mobility choices.</h5>
